Hi there, I'm Tean Lai and I want to be lazy! Laziness isn't exactly a bad thing though, it makes me highly efficient so I can create more time for myself to do nothing. So I'm now an undergrad studying CS, because I want to keep learning more ways to program things to do work for me. Apologies for the empty GitHub (for now!), it's definitely going to grow as I grow.
