Hi there, I'm Tean Lai and I want to be lazy! So I'm now an undergrad studying CS at Cornell, because I want to keep learning more ways to program things to do work for me. Although I've been programming for a while now, my journey is only getting started! Apologies for the empty GitHub (for now!), it's definitely going to grow when I find time to upload my projects.

tean-lai/tean-lai is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
